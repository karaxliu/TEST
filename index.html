		<!-- visa -->
			<div class="cell">
				<h2>Visa</h2>
				<p>Travelling to China requires a visa. As long as you have all of the required documents, the process is relatively simple and usually takes about 1 week. We recommend getting it done at least 2 months prior to travel, on the off chance a resubmission is needed.</p>
					<h3 style="font-style: bold;">You will likely need:</h3>
					<p>
						<ul>
						<li> Passport (including any expired previous passports)</li>
						<li><a style="text-decoration: underline;" target="blank" href="http://au.china-embassy.org/eng/ls/bg/P020160114417040761211.pdf">Application form</a>, available via your resident country's Chinese consulate website</li>
						<li>2x current passport photos</li>
						<li>Flight & accommodation bookings (you can book fully refundable options for visa application purposes)</li> 
					</ul>
					<p>Submit your application at a <a target="blank" style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://au.china-embassy.org/eng/ls/vfc/t1423980.htm">Visa Application Centre</a>. We recommend going early in the morning to avoid a long wait. 
					<br><span>&nbsp</span>
					<br>Alternatively, there is a 72 hour transit option requiring no visa, provided that you are travelling out via a THIRD DESTINATION OUTSIDE MAINLAND CHINA. For example, if you are flying from Melbourne to Shanghai, then from Shanghai to Tokyo, you may use this option. However, if you are flying from Melbourne to Shanghai, then Shanghai to Melbourne (or any other cities in Australia), you must apply for a visa. If you need help, you know how to reach us!</p>
			</div>

		<!-- flying in -->
			<div class="cell">
				<h2>Flying In</h2>
				<p>
					You will land in one of Shanghai's two airports: Pudong and Hongqiao. The best way to get to your hotel is via taxi as they are inexpensive and convenient. Make sure you go to the official airport taxi stand and only take taxis with a top light and a working meter. Taxi drivers do not solicite travellers for business. If anyone approaches you in or outside the terminal offering taxi or car service, it is best to ignore them no matter what they say (e.g. they might say the taxis don't go to your specified hotel). 
					<br><span>&nbsp</span>
					<br>Barring awful traffic, a taxi ride from Pudong to downtown (e.g. the bund) should be about 200RMB, no more than 250RMB. 
					<br><span>&nbsp</span>
					<br>A taxi ride from Hongqiao to downtown should be about 50-70RMB. 
					<br><span>&nbsp</span>
					<br>Tipping is not necessary in China.
				</p>

		<!-- stay -->
			<div class="cell">
				<h2>Stay</h2>
				<p>
					There are hundreds of accommodation options in Shanghai, from luxury hotels to Airbnbs. 
					<br><span>&nbsp</span>
					<br>The best areas to stay in are the historic Jing'an District and Huangpu District. Both districts allows easy access to The Bund and the Old French Concession. You will be surround by beautiful architecture from the colonial period, a blend eastern and western building styles. Wonderful coffee, dining and shopping options are also in abundance. The neighbouring Xuhui District and Changning Districts are convenient and accessible alternative options.

			<div class="cell">
				<h2>Getting Around</h2>
				<p>
					Subway 
					<br>Shanghai's subway system is excellent. Clean, modern, frequent and with extremely high geographical coverage. Almost all signs are bilingual so it's fairly easy to get around. You can purchase single trip tickets with <a style="font-style: bold;">cash</a> or purchase a pre-loaded <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguides/shanghai/transportation/card-use.htm">Shanghai Public Transportation Card</a>, which can be used for subway, taxi, bus, and if you fancy, ferry. 
					<br><span>&nbsp</span>
					<br>Taxi 
					<br>Convenient and inexpensive. Most major sightseeing spots will have a taxi stand. Be careful of unlicensed cars as they will always overcharge and try to take you the long way. Only take taxis with a top light and a working meter. 
					<br><span>&nbsp</span>
					<br>Didi
					<br>China's Uber. If you purchase a Chinese SIM card (available at the airport or Tel-co stores), you will be able to download and use the app. 
					<br><span>&nbsp</span>
					<br>Bike Share
					<br>Travel like a local and ride a bike. Download one of the many bike sharing apps to. But be careful and do watch out for cars! 
					<br><span>&nbsp</span>
					<br>Walking
					<br>Although Shanghai is massive, little pockets are very walkable and fun to explore on foot. Hop over to [Things To Do] to see our recommendations.

				<h2>Travel Tips</h2>
				<p>
					Payment
					<br>most global chains (starbucks, etc.) and large department stores accept Mastercard and Visa. However it is best to exchange some cash for taxi, subway, markets, etc.
					<br><span>&nbsp</span>
					<br>Internet Access
					<br>Download either ExpressVPN or NordVPN before your trip, you should be able to use go on all the sites and use all the apps with no problems. 
					<br><span>&nbsp</span>
					<br>Maps
					<br>google maps isn't the most reliable in China. Apple Maps is better. Autonavi Navigation is a good app to have as it is more reliable in China.
					<br><span>&nbsp</span>
					<br>Water
					<br>Tap water is not drinkable in China. Go for bottled water or do what the locals do, bring tap water to a boil and cool it down. Most hotels supply a kettle in the room. 
					<br><span>&nbsp</span>
					<br>Food
					<br>Generally it is perfectly safe to eat in restaurants in Shanghai. Street foods are generally ok, too. But it is not a bad idea to bring some stomach meds. 
					<br><span>&nbsp</span>
					<br>Emergencies
					<br>Ambulance: 120
					<br>Police: 110
					<br>Fire: 119
